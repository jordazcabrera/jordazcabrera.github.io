     <p>The information in this page is for my CNIT-132 class assignment at City Collegue of San Francisco. The assignment was to participate in one meeting or workshop related to web development. In 1/29/19, I joined a group called <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Learn-to-Code-Thinkful-San-Francisco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Learn to Code | Thinkful San Francisco</a> through <span class="thinkful">MeetUp.</span></p>
     <p><span class="thinkful">MeetUp</span> is a global platform where people with similar interest come together to create, share, find and attend events. It is easy to sing up and most importantly it is free! Some of the things I learned by joining a group is that you definitely learn new things, find the support you need, and help you get out of your comfort zone.</p>
     <p><span class="thinkful">Thinkful San Francisco</span> is a new type of online school that can help you build a career in web development and data science by offering different bootcamps in frontend and backend development.</p>

<h3>Learn to Code - Group</h3>
     <p>This is the group I joined and it offered multiple workshops pretty much every day. In the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Learn-to-Code-Thinkful-San-Francisco/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> events </a> section of the group page you can find a vast variety of courses. I went to more than one meetings but the two I enjoyed the most were <span class="thinkful">Build Your Own Website</span> and <span class="thinkful">Front-End</span>.</p>     
     <p>These are some of the things I learned in both meetings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>How the Web works</li>
            <li>Client vs Server</li>
            <li>Front Developers vs Backend Developers</li>
            <li>HTML Structure</li>
            <li>HTML: tags, elements, and attributes.</li>
            <li>CSS: selectors, properties, and values.</li>
            <li>Use of <a href="https://codepen.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> CodePen </a>, a social development environment for front-end designers and developers.</li>
        </ul> 
    <p>In every meeting, you get access to two-week free trial. You also do a video conference with a Thinkful Project Manager who gives you information about how Thinkful platform and programs work.</p>
